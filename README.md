# tachyus_backend_coding_challenge

This repo contains an F# file with a tail recursive implementation of the classical Gram Schmidt algorithm with normalization that produces a set of orthonormal vectors spanning the same space of a given set of linearly independent vectors as input.

To modify the input of the program, adjust the "main" function at the end of the file.
